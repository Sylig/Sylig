## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ <br></br> About me


I'm a passionate and dedicated developer with a good foundation in JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, and an understanding of UX and UI design.

Recently, I successfully completed a university-certified full-stack web development bootcamp with a grade of 100%. 
This intensive program provided me with valuable hands-on experience and honed my skills in building web applications.

Driven by curiosity and a thirst for knowledge, I continuously seek to expand my skillset and stay up to date with the latest trends in the industry. With a focus on React.js and Node.js, I'm always looking for new challenges to enhance my expertise.

I believe that life is a continuous learning process, and I'm excited to embrace new technologies and explore different areas.
