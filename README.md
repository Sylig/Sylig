## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ <br></br> About me


I'm a passionate and dedicated developer with a good foundation in JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS.

Driven by a passion for technology and a past academic background in User Experience Design and Media I, recently and successfully, completed a university-certified Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp with a grade of 100%. 
This intensive program provided me with valuable hands-on experience and honed my skills in building web applications.

Motivated by curiosity and a lust for learning, I seek to expand my skillset and stay up to date with the latest trends in the industry. 
With a focus on React.js and Node.js, I'm always looking for new challenges to enhance my expertise.
